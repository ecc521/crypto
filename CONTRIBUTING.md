In order to make these librarys easy to maintain and use, a standard format should be followed. If you must break the format, please explain why in your pull request.

Ease of Use:
- All function names should be lowercase
- All functions should run in a Web Worker
- All function should run in the browser.
- Calling lib.duplicate() should duplicate the library

Maintainability:
- A non-minified version of all code should be easily available.
