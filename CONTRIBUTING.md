In order to make these librarys easy to use, please follow these guildlines:
1. Make all function names lowercase - no worrying about capitals anywhere.
2. Do not minify code, and try to make it easy to follow. You can create a minified version for exporting.
3. Make all functions run without other librarys. It is ok if you require a function from the library it is in, however if your function requires another library, please explicitly document it and throw an descriptive error message if the user doesn't have the other function library.
