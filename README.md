## A JavaScript function library for cryptographic operations

*This function library is mostly intended for educational and practice purposes - Some functions have not been optimized to the extent that they should where performance is an issue.*

# This will be undergoing some major changes shortly as the documentation is transferred over, some functions are removed, some functions are added, and some functions are changed. DO NOT USE YET.
